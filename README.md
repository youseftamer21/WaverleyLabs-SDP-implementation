This project works by running sdpController.js on an ubuntu virtual machine, and to run SDP client using electron on windows. you need an ubuntu server virtual os, and you need to adjust the settings on the virtual machine software to use the same internet adapter as the one you're using on windows. you need to copy all the files except for sdp client into ubuntu. and you need to install apache 2 so you can run a server, and then run sdpController.js. then you need to copy sdp client to windows and install electron and run it in the file.
